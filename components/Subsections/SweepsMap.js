        <div className="paragraph">The City of Portland is currently spending an estimated $4,818,306.00 on its ineffectual and harmful sweep-evictions and personnel hours diverted to responding to problems arising from our punishing public policies toward our unsheltered neighbors (Evans & Lindsey, 2018). In 2017 our city evicted 1,377 camps. From January through October of 2018, 1,845 camps were disrupted. These numbers alone shock the conscience; yet they do not even include the additional Department of Transportation-run evictions, nor do they include the "clean-ups" run by private crews paid for by businesses in the downtown and Lloyd districts, who frequently confiscate private property. With 1,668 unsheltered residents for ALL of Portland, Gresham, and Multnomah County counted by the government in 2017, the magnitude and serial character of the cruelty we are inflicting on our most economically and physically vulnerable citizens is truly alarming.</div>

          Even more upsetting is the fact that this barrage of punishment has not accomplished and cannot accomplish its purported goal; despite serial eviction and harassment, the estimated number of campsites in Portland remains stable at about 110 week in and week out. This is because sweep-evictions seek to

          Additionally, these policies steeply increase the fining and jailing of our neighbors for survival-related offenses. They cause loss of life-sustaining survival gear, missed school and work, and postponed health, counseling, and housing appointments. These harms traumatize and raise impossible barriers to re-entering secure housing. The result is general discouragement and suffering we all feel as we watch people pushed from one block to the next, to jail and back (
