            In this data and documentary analysis of Portlandâ€™s response to houselessness, we examine how our public complaint-driven system has lead to counter-productive sweep-evictions, over-policing and unequal access to hygiene and waste services that harm all. Revealing how punitive policies increase trauma, waste, and barriers to stable housing, we suggest how alternate, evidence-proven programs might fix rather than paper-over our current problems.
